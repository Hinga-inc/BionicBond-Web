        <head>Limb Care</head><br>
        <p>
           <b>. New amputees should shower or bathe in the evening rather than the morning</b>, 
            as hot water causes limbs to swell, which makes it more difficult to fit prostheses. <br>
            . <b> We recommend wearing a shrinker</b> at first to compress your remaining limb until such 
             time you no longer need to. <br>
            . <b> For both below-knee (transtibial) and above-knee amputations</b>, 
            post-artificial limb care guidelines recommend avoiding the use of pillows under or between the legs 
            during sleep, as this can lead to difficulties in straightening the knee or hip. This can affect mobility and comfort. <br>
            . <b>Do daily stretching exercises recommended by your doctor</b>. These straighten the knee and hip to provide
             increased comfort when lying down and walking. Although it might seem unnecessary, prosthesis daily
              stretching is crucial for maintaining mobility! <br>

        <head>Skin Care</head><br>
        <p>Skin complications are a common concern for amputees and require vigilant attention. 
            The enclosed environment created by prosthetic devices often leads to a range of skin issues. <br> <br>

        <h1><b>Some of the Amputee Skin Care Tips are :-</b></h1><br>
        . <b>Wash your limb once a day with mild soap and warm water</b>, and pat it completely dry to avoid fungal growth.
         It's important to change dressings daily, or more often if they become saturated. <br>
        . <b>Always examine your skin before and after wearing your prosthetic</b>. If there are signs of persistent redness, 
        ulceration, tears, or scrapes, let your doctor and prosthetist know immediately. If red patches last more than 
        a few minutes after you remove your prosthesis, this could be a sign your socket needs checking. <br>
        . <b>As we noted, prosthetic skin care is essential</b>. Because residual limbs are enclosed in plastic sockets
        , perspiration is likely and normal. However, this can also be a source of odor and bacteria. 
        Sprinkling a small amount of powder can help, as well as changing the prosthetic sock to keep things dry and comfortable. 
        Perspiration generally subsides with persistent prosthetic use. <br>
        . <b>Consult your doctor before using lotions, ointments, or powders</b>. These may irritate the skin or cause inflammation.
         Be sure to hydrate your dry skin at night when you're not using your prosthesis. Keeping your skin moisturized is vital as dry 
         skin is more fragile.
        . <b>Check your skin often, especially if you have decreased sensations</b>. A mirror may be helpful if you can't see your limb, 
        and know that solutions for excessive sweating are available.
        If you notice redness, callouses, irritation, blisters, and breakdown, or if your prosthesis doesn't feel right, remove it and check your skin.
         Be sure to tell your health care providers so they can help you remedy the issue or direct you to the appropriate care.
          General skin irritation and allergic reactions are often a result of soaps, cleansers, manufacturing chemicals, and lotions. <br><br>
         Remember, care of residual limb after amputation is an ongoing process and early intervention can prevent complications.

        <head> General Prosthetic Care</head><br>
        <p>
            <h2><b>Do's</b></h2>
           . <b> Clean Daily</b>: Keep your prosthesis clean with a damp cloth and mild soap for thermoplastic sockets and liners.
            For myoelectric prosthetics, wipe and leave them to dry overnight. <br>
        . <b>Wear Fresh Liners and Socks</b>: To maintain hygiene, wear new liners and/or socks every day to minimize bacterial growth. <br>
        . <b>Inspect Daily</b>: Give your prosthesis a quick once-over each day to catch any wear and tear or loose components. <br>
        . <b>See Your Prosthetist Regularly</b>: Regular check-ups help ensure optimal function of your prosthesis and keep you updated with the latest advancements. <br>
        . <b>Store Carefully</b>: Place prostheses in a secure location where they won't get knocked over, 
        and avoid storing them in direct sunlight, near ovens, or close to radiators to protect against damage from a hot environment. <br><br>
<h2><b>Don'ts:</b></h2><br>
. <b>Avoid DIY Modifications</b>: Don't make adjustments to your prosthesis yourself, especially if it's making strange 
noises. Consult your prosthetist for any changes. <br>
. <b>Steer Clear of Water</b>: Keep the device away from fresh or salt water to prevent rusting and damage to 
sensitive components. If you can't avoid frequent contact with water, consult your prosthetist about the option
 of a waterproof prosthesis. <br>
. <b>Don't Overexert</b>: Take breaks as needed, especially during the initial phases of rehabilitation, 
to avoid straining your limb. <br>
. <b>Avoid Leaving in Visible Spots in Cars</b>: Don't leave your prosthesis completely visible in your car to
 minimize the risk of theft and damage from heat. <br>
